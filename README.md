this is just a start and let's see how far we can go with it.


- Make a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv venv
```

- Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Run the application:
```
python app.py
```

### Do not forget to set up your Google Generative AI API key as an environment variable:
```
export GOOGLE_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
```
